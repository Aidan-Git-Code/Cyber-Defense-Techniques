The docker service is set up with an ssh port on port 2222 with default credentials of bluteam:blueteam. The red team need to figure out that it is a misconfigured docker service and then realize that they can mount filesystems within the container. Finding the right system to mount is the next step:

Seeing the /dev/vda1 being a 40G partition, we can assume that it’s the main host partition and mount that to any folder we see fit.

Further persistence achievable through adding an ssh key into the host machine.

The very barebones ubuntu install does not come with any nice text editors we are used to, so echoing into the authorized keys file is the way to go.
